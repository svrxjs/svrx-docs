# Install svrx

We strongly recommand to use official cli tool to manage `svrx`.
You can use `svrx` at any place in your system after installing `svrx-cli` globally. 

```bash
npm install -g svrx-cli
```

HINT: `svrx-cli` is used to install and load `svrx` with a specific version(default to the latest one),
which has nothing to do with the version of `svrx-cli` itself. 
You can specify the svrx version you want in command line or the `.svrxrc.js` file.  

`svrx-cli` stored the versions of `svrx` into `~/.svrx`, you can use another directory by setting the `SVRX_DIR` environment variable.
